<h1>CRUD API</h1>

<p>Simple CRUD API using Node.js and MongoDB. Also using babel and webpack to use latest JavaScript while keeping backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Check deployed version <a href="https://ricardo-crud-api.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>To run, open project root folder on terminal, do 'npm install' then 'npm start'.</p>

<p>Note that 'app-production.js' is the entry point built by webpack, so any changes to other JS files (such as app.js) have to go though webpack building again.</p>

<p>To rebuild, simply do 'npm run build' after having done the 'npm install'.</p>

<p>Make sure Mongo.DB is installed, and keep '/MongoDB/Server/4.0/bin/mongod' process running to use DB functionality.</p>
